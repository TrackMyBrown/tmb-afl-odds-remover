Let's End Gambling Ads

This simple chrome extension will replace the gambling odds on the afl.com.au website with "#EndGamblingAds" instead.

This protects the vulnerable in our community. Those struggling with gambling addiction or young children just wanting to watch their favorite sport.

The extension works in either Google Chrome or Edge desktop browsers.

Deploy it at home to protect your family or at school to protect a whole bunch of kids.
